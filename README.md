# Hyperautomation Lane Detection
Repository for Masterpraktikum - Hyperautomation: Group autonomous driving. We used Galen Ballews Lane Detect [Algorithm](https://github.com/galenballew/SDC-Lane-and-Vehicle-Detection-Tracking/tree/master/Part%20II%20-%20Adv%20Lane%20Detection%20and%20Road%20Features). This is the Hyperautomated [Algorithm](https://github.com/patrickahrend/hyperautomation-lane-detection/blob/main/Part%20II%20-%20Adv%20Lane%20Detection%20and%20Road%20Features%202/Part%20II%20-%20Adv%20Lane%20Detection%20and%20Road%20Features%202/hyperautomated_algorithm.ipynb) and the results can be found [here](https://github.com/patrickahrend/hyperautomation-lane-detection/tree/main/Part%20II%20-%20Adv%20Lane%20Detection%20and%20Road%20Features%202/Part%20II%20-%20Adv%20Lane%20Detection%20and%20Road%20Features%202/dataset_output) and [here](https://github.com/patrickahrend/hyperautomation-lane-detection/tree/main/Part%20II%20-%20Adv%20Lane%20Detection%20and%20Road%20Features%202/Part%20II%20-%20Adv%20Lane%20Detection%20and%20Road%20Features%202/result_plots).
